        <p>Hi there👋, and welcome to my site! Here, I share the things I've learned while working with SolidWorks. I started this project as a way to explore web development while sharing something meaningful. This isn't meant to be a full tutorial—there are already plenty of those out there. Instead, you'll find helpful tips, interesting features, and solutions to challenges I've encountered along the way.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

        <p>On this site, you'll discover practical solutions, useful tips, problems I've encountered, and new features I've discovered during my work with SolidWorks. 
            Additionally, I've been writing VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks, such as formatting parts tables, which saves time and makes SolidWorks more efficient. 
            I've developed several reusable VBA functions that I use regularly, and I plan to add these functions to the site in the future. T
            his will not only benefit others but also serve as a handy reference for myself.</p>

        <p>Whether you're just starting out with SolidWorks or you've been using it for years, I hope you'll find something useful here—maybe a new feature to explore or a tip to make your work easier. 
            My goal is to provide content that helps you solve problems and get more out of SolidWorks.</p>

        <h2>Why I Created This Site</h2>

        <p>I created this site because I wanted to learn how to build a website and share something meaningful with others. My experiences with SolidWorks seemed like the perfect fit. 
        Whenever I encounter problems or discover new features, I do some research to understand the mechanics behind them. 
        If I feel my discoveries could be useful to someone else, I'll share them here—you may encounter the same problems as I do. The website is still a work in progress, and I'm constantly adding new content as I discover more.</p>
