        <p>Hi thereðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my site! Here, I share the things I've learned while working with SolidWorks. I started this project as a way to explore web development while sharing something meaningful. This isn't meant to be a full tutorialâ€”there are already plenty of those out there. Instead, you'll find helpful tips, interesting features, and solutions to challenges I've encountered along the way.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p>On this site, you'll discover practical solutions, useful tips, problems I've encountered, and new features I've discovered during my work with SolidWorks. Additionally, I've been writing VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks, such as formatting parts tables, which saves time and makes SolidWorks more efficient. I've developed several reusable VBA functions that I use regularly, and I plan to add these functions to the site in the future. This will not only benefit others but also serve as a handy reference for myself.</p>

        <p>Whether you're just starting out with SolidWorks or you've been using it for years, I hope you'll find something useful hereâ€”maybe a new feature to explore or a tip to make your work easier. My goal is to provide content that helps you solve problems and get more out of SolidWorks.</p>

        <h2>Why I Created This Site</h2>
        <p>I created this site because I wanted to learn how to build a website and share something meaningful with others. My experiences with SolidWorks seemed like the perfect fit. Whenever I encounter problems or discover new features, I do some research to understand the mechanics behind them. If I feel my discoveries could be useful to someone else, I'll share them hereâ€”you may encounter the same problems as I do. The website is still a work in progress, and I'm constantly adding new content as I discover more. If you'd like to know more about how I created the site, visit the About page.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Marino, a mechanical engineering student from Switzerland. I also work in the industry while studying, and I've been using SolidWorks for several yearsâ€”itâ€™s an important tool for both my studies and my job. I enjoy writing VBA macros to automate tasks in SolidWorks, making my work more efficient.</p>

        <p>When I discover new features or technologies, I like to explore them and understand how they work. This curiosity goes beyond SolidWorks; I'm also interested in software, IT, and AI. In fact, this website was built with the help of AI. This website is my way of learning web development while sharing what I've learned with others.</p>

        <p>Outside of SolidWorks, I enjoy working on personal projects that help me learn new skills, and I plan to share some of those projects here soon. Feel free to look around, and keep an eye out for updates. Thanks for visitingâ€”I hope you find something helpful!</p>
