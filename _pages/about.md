# About me

Hello! I'm Marino from Switzerland. I'm studying mechanical engineering, and I work a lot with SolidWorks. Over time, I've learned a lot about it and also started writing VBA macros to make working with SolidWorks easier.

I created this website to share what I've learned. Whether you're new to SolidWorks or already familiar with it, I hope you'll find some useful tips here. I really enjoy solving problems and making things more efficient, and I want to help others do the same.

I'm also planning to share some of my personal projects soonâ€”things that show my journey in engineering and some of my own ideas. These projects are a mix of what I've learned in my studies and things I've worked on in my free time. They represent my passion for engineering and my curiosity about how things work.

In addition to SolidWorks and VBA, I'm also interested in other areas of engineering and technology. I'm always learning something new, and I believe that sharing knowledge makes the learning process even better for everyone.

Thanks for visiting! I hope you find something interesting here!
