Hi, I'm Marino, a mechanical engineering student from Switzerland. I also work in the industry while studying, and I've been using SolidWorks for several years—it’s an important tool for both my studies and my job. I enjoy writing VBA macros to automate tasks in SolidWorks, making my work more efficient.

Whenever I discover new features or technologies, I like to explore them and understand how they work. This curiosity goes beyond SolidWorks; I'm also interested in software, IT, and AI. In fact, this website was built with the help of AI. This website is my way of learning web development while sharing what I've learned with others.

Outside of SolidWorks, I enjoy working on personal projects that help me learn new skills, and I plan to share some of those projects here soon. Feel free to look around, and keep an eye out for updates. Thanks for visiting—I hope you find something helpful!
