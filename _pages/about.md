Hi, I'm Marino, a mechanical engineering student from Switzerland. Additionally, while studying, I work in the machining industry, focusing on mechanical design and product development. I've been using SolidWorks for several years. It's an important tool for both my studies and my job, helping me bring designs to life. Additionally, I started writing VBA macros to automate tasks in SolidWorks. Over time, I've gathered extensive knowledge of VBA and the SolidWorks API, and have written several automation macros.

Curiosity led me to create this website with the goal of building my own site while keeping costs as low as possible. GitHub Pages allows me to host my site for free, while the only thing I've spent money on so far is the web domain. To build the site, I used Jekyll, a static site generator, along with the Minimal Mistakes theme. Both Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes are great tools for creating a fast, simple website—check them out if you're interested in web development.

When I discover new features or technologies, I like to explore them and understand how they work. This curiosity goes beyond SolidWorks. I'm also interested in software and AI, which often ties back to my work by helping me find new ways to improve efficiency and solve problems. In fact, this website was built with the help of AI. This site is my way of learning web development while sharing what I've learned with others.

Beyond SolidWorks, I work on personal projects that help me learn new skills, and I plan to share some of these projects here soon. I also like swimming to stay active and clear my mind. Feel free to look around, and keep an eye out for updates. If you like what you see, make sure to check back regularly. Thanks for visiting—I hope you find something helpful!
